<h1>Aphasia</h1>
</center>

I am completely normal

I have the words in my head

But I just cant put them together when I speak ahead

So everyone thinks I'm abnormal instead

<br>

People say i'm realyy awkward

I have no friends but thats fine

As I know they exist just forpassing time

I love enjoying my peacetime

<br>

I stay completely silent

Cause no one really understands what I'm trying to say

I am Totally helpless in my in my lonely way

How should I convey

<br>

But still hoping to get okay

Very soon someday

Until then I'll try to live someway

Or just giveup and die away

<br>
