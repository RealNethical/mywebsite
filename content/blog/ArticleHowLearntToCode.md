<h1>How I learnt to code</h1>
</center>
I was always attracted to tech stuff since childhood. I used to love breaking things and understand the logic behind how it worked. The first programming language I learnt was Html I belive (Although i know html is not a programming langauge) but I still have no clue how I learnt it and when I learnt it as i tend to forget things , So this is also one of the reason for me to write this blog so I again dont forget as much I remember. The language I then learnt was The "BASIC" programming language although I am a now an anti-Microsoft Person.

At the mid of my summer holidays (dont know the year) I was badly exited to create my own Android app. By that time I had learnt to decompile and modify applications. One day, I was just searching about ways to program an Android App and I came across this app known as "Sketchware" and yea, that was it , After that moment I spent hours and hours learning About Android Apps and the Android Framework. I even Started uploading tutorials about skecthware on youtube and some of them got quite viral and even some of my projects went viral , I had then got quite some fame in this community. I further learnt Java and started using Android Studio . I learnt many more languages like python, kotlin, c, c++, Rust.

As I started to use android studio , I released that my pc was too weak for this. I asked for help regarding this on some servers and two people named, Ixyan and GianXd recommended me to use Linux. I had very less knowledege about linux and foss at that time. I quickly downloaded the Xubuntu Iso file and flashed it on pc. After that moment , I fell in love with linux and its ecosystem. I had then decided not to switch to any other os and now it has beeen years of me using differnet linux distros. (Imaging Viewing this blog on a non-Linux device :trollsad:)
