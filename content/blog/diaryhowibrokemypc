<h1>How My broke my pc</h1>
</center>

This week hasn't been going quite good for me.
Yesterday I was just cleaning my pc and I opened it for cleaning it even better.It was all good until I tried to reattach my lcd Screen to the motherboard and yea guess what, I inserted it the wrong way and now my lcd is totally broken.
Now i am totally depended on my phone to code. My pc was a very important part of my life and I was very much attached to it. It was my best friend and companion , I had heavily modified it's hardware so it could perform better and yea my one silly mistake led to it's screen being destroyed. I am so dumb that i didn't even try to create a ssh server on the pc before so i could somehow run it temporarily from termux. 
I can buy a external monitor but i dont really have money to do so or a friend to whom I could ask for a monitor and setup a ssh server. So yea, today i just buyed a otg cable so i could atleast code on my phone with a keyboard but when I tried to test the otg with the keyboard, that shit didn't work and yea the shop doesn't allow returning. My phones lcd too broke today and now the screen gets burn when i stay on the same page for more that 60sec. Bruh.
