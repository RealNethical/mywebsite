<h1>After You Killed Yourself</h1>
</center>

You thought,

After you kill yourself

You would no longer be in pain,

You would no longer be a burden,

You would no longer be inflicted by your loved ones,

you would no longer be lonely

<br>

But,

After you killed yourself,

Your mother fell on her knees and cried,

with all your photos and clothes lyinh beside,

Sometimes randomly imagining if it was all a drean and you did'nt die,

<br>

After you killed yourself,

Your father had tears in his eye,

and was totally  broken from deep inside,

After reading your sucide note kept in your notebook beside.

<br>

After your Killed yourself,

your brothes were shocked,

thinking how come they did'nt knew you suffered,

and stood bold keeping their eyes locked.

<br>

After you killed yourself,

your dog patiently waited for you,

Everytime someone would visit he would go running thinking it was you,

but continued waiting after knew it wasn't you

<br>

After you killed yourself,

your relatives thought,

Whatif? they did not always taunt you,

Whatif? they didnot compare your,

Whatif? they instead motivated you.

Would it all be the same ?

<br>

After you killed yourself your teachers regretted,

How could'nt they stop and talk to you? ,

How come they didn't knew you could'nt take anymore? ,

how come they ignored you?

<br>

As I continued to talk to my dead body,

I told him at the end,

We had so many dreams to fullfill,

We had so many things to learn,

We had so many places to visit,

We had so many people who loved us,

Yet you became selfish and killed yourself without even thinking about the ones that loved you.

You must have needed a lot of will to kill yourself,

Why did'nt you use it to save yourself,

You didn't even thought twice before killing yourself,

Now try Unkilling yourself.

<br>
