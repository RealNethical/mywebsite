<h1>Sad</h1>
</center>

The Roses are dying

Outside I'm laughing

Inside I'm Crying

But i'm still trying

<br>

Hoping to find Happiness

Even in this Blackness

Its not my madness

Its just the sadness

<br>

I always try to enjoy life

But never can

I love the lonely night

thinking about ways to reduce my lifespan

<br>

My brain always reminds me of things I fear

The Sun has come up and given me another day

So I'll have to play again here

And I'm okay is what I'll say

<br>
