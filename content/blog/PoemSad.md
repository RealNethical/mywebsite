<h1>Sad</h1>
</center>

The Roses are dying

Outside I'm laughing

Inside I'm Crying

But i'm still trying

<br>

Hoping to find Happiness

Even in this Blackness

Its not my madness

Its just the sadness

<br>

I always try to enjoy life

But never can

Maybe I'm  not really fine

or Maybe I'm just broken

<br>

No matter how long the road

I'll be a better me when i get back home

Then i wont be anymore controlled

And I would also not be alone

<br>
