<h1>After You Killed Yourself</h1>
</center>
<p>You thought,</p>
<p>After you kill yourself</p>
<p>You would no longer be in pain,</p>
<p>You would no longer be a burden,</p>
<p>You would no longer be inflicted by your loved ones,</p>
<p>you would no longer be lonely.</p>
<br>
<p>But,</p>
<p>After you killed yourself,</p>
<p>Your mother fell on her knees and cried,</p>
<p>with all your photos and clothes lying beside,</p>
<p>Sometimes randomly imagining if it was all a dream and you did'nt die,</p>
<br>
<p>After you killed yourself,</p>
<p>Your father had tears in his eye,</p>
<p>and was totally  broken from deep inside,</p>
<p>After reading your suicide note kept in your notebook beside.</p>
<br>
<p>After your Killed yourself,</p>
<p>your brothes were shocked,</p>
<p>thinking how come they did'nt knew you suffered,</p>
<p>and stood bold keeping their eyes locked.</p>
<br>
<p>After you killed yourself,</p>
<p>your dog patiently waited for you,</p>
<p>Everytime someone would visit he would go running thinking it was you,</p>
<p>but continued waiting after knew it wasn't you</p>
<br>
<p>After you killed yourself,</p>
<p>your relatives thought,</p>
<p>Whatif? they did not always taunt you,</p>
<p>Whatif? they didnot compare your,</p>
<p>Whatif? they instead motivated you.</p>
<p>Would it all be the same ?</p>
<br>
<p>After you killed yourself your teachers regretted,</p>
<p>How could'nt they stop and talk to you? ,</p>
<p>How come they didn't knew you could'nt take anymore? ,</p>
<p>how come they ignored you?</p>
<br>
<p>As I continued to talk to my dead body,</p>
<p>I told him at the end,</p>
<p>We had so many dreams to fullfill,</p>
<p>We had so many things to learn,</p>
<p>We had so many places to visit,</p>
<p>We had so many people who loved us,</p>
<p>Yet you became selfish and killed yourself without even thinking about the ones that loved you.</p>
<p>You must have needed a lot of will to kill yourself,</p>
<p>Why did'nt you use it to save yourself,</p>
<p>You didn't even thought twice before killing yourself,</p>
<p>Now try Unkilling yourself.</p>
