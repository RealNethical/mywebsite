<p>The wind whispers through the trees
A restless sound that never cease
It carries with it a sense of unease
A feeling that something is not at ease</p>
<p>The branches sway, a dance of doubt
As if they too are filled with worry
The leaves rustle, a troubled shout
As if they can't help but hurry</p>
<p>The clouds roll in, a gray despair
A reflection of the heart's despair
The rain falls, a tearful prayer
A release from all the care</p>
<p>But nature is resilient, it finds a way
To weather the storm and see the day
It reminds us that our fears and doubts
Are only temporary, they will fade away</p>
<p>So take a breath and look around
Find solace in the sights and sounds
Nature has a way of calming the mind
Leaving worries and fears behind</p>
