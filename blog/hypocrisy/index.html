<h1>title be like</h1>

We are but actors on a grand stage
Performing for an audience, playing a role
We put on a show, a perfect facade
Hiding who we really are, our true goal
<p>The masks we wear are never to be laid
We say one thing, do another
We preach what we do not follow
Our words and deeds, a constant bother</p>
<p>Hypocrisy runs deep, it's everywhere
In the words we speak, the actions we bare
It eats at our soul, it poisons our heart
Tearing us apart, tearing us apart</p>
<p>But perhaps one day, we'll shed the lies
And be true to ourselves, to others, to the skies
We'll let go of the masks, the pretense, the guise
And live our truth, no matter the size</p>
<p>We'll rise above the hypocrisy that surrounds
That holds us back, that weighs us down
We'll break free from the chains that bind
And be the people we were meant to find.</p>
