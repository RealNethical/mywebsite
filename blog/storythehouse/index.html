<h1>The house</h1>
</center>
<p>The house was quiet, with only the sound of the floorboards creaking softly in the silence. As I entered the room, a shiver ran down my spine. I had the sense that something evil was hidden in the darkness, watching me.</p>
<p>I tried to shout for help, but the words got stuck in my throat. I saw a shadowy figure in the corner of the room, standing perfectly still and staring at me. My heart pounded in my chest and I started to retreat, but the figure moved closer and closer, filling me with a sense of impending doom.</p>
<p>I couldn't take it any longer. I spun around and fled, but I could feel the figure following me as I ran. My heart pounded in my chest as I sprinted towards the door, not stopping until I was out in the open air. I didn't dare look back, knowing that if I saw those figures again, I might lose all hope.
I risked a glance over my shoulder, but the figure was nowhere to be seen. I didn't know if it was still chasing me or if it had given up, and I didn't want to stick around to find out.
I fled into the night, my mind racing and my body trembling. I knew I had just narrowly escaped a fate worse than death, and I vowed to never set foot in that house again.</p>
