<h1>My personalitiy be like</h1>
</center>
<p>I always feel like I have no personality. When I look at other people, I can clearly see their personality but when I think about mine, I am blank. Everytime when I ask someone to describe me, they come up with different answers.
I have no certain likes, dislikes or any of my own choices, I just feel like I pretend to be someone. I might seem like I am obsessed with some things but actually,it's because I've been with people who likes them for a long period of time and it goes for literally everything I so called like and use. When I'm alone i talk to myself A LOT, literally I sometimes can't focous on doing tasks because I'm busy talking with myself inside me.
I like remaining silent and calm and talk less to people. Anyway everyone just prejudices about me before i even talk to them so, yea I just don't like society and it's f people who talk about racism, feminism, equality etc and do opposite of what they say.
anyway, i just found no one to talk with or with whom I could share my thoughts so, just shared it here to feel a bit ok.</p>
