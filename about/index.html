<h3>About Me</h3>
</center>
My pc broke btw.
<p>I usually used to play a lot of video games until I realised all the games were same, even when they may look different from outside. They all have some programming logic inside which could be easily cracked and everything has vulnerabilities or loopholes. I then spent hours cracking and modifying simple android applications and also learnt basic smali myself just from repeatedly editing smali files. I then started learning more and more about Android and started developing my own apps.</p>
<p>Once I was just hanging out on a programming server on Discord when some of the people told me about linux and recommended me to use it. I knew very little about Linux that time because schools really only teach about windows and propetiary softwares while we still have various better FOSS alternatives. I then tried linux for the first time and I have now fallen in love with it and I have decided to never change my os. Seriously, I dont understand why people just dont use open source softwares instead of pirating propetery software.</p>
<p>I give all the remaining time that I get from School, Studying, Working, Doing homework etc to my Computer and my projects. I am not really good at anything except Computers. I dont know why but I am afraid of doing certain things even when I know that I can do them. I am a guy that has multiple personalities, different with different people. I sometimes become a whole new person who is unrecognizable. I have tried doing every possible thing but i have now realised I am not good at anything. I get trolled by people for the things that I do wrong in the fields they are good in. My only true companion is my computer which is connected to this crazy technology, the INTERNET!.
Whenever I am reacting about something , I am just faking it, deep down I dont give a damn about it. In my mind , I think completely different from what I or my emotions say.</p>

<h3>Friends</h3>

<p>I dont really know why I am sharing it here and I dont even know whether these people consider me as friends as this world is full of fake people and promises :). If you consider me as my friend and your name isn't here, I would be happy to add it ;).</p>
